
To make the app fully Unicode compatible, take care that the following things are not in your *.pas;*.dfm;*.SQL files:

Delphi:	TStringField		should be	TWideStringField
Delphi:	.AsString		should be	.AsWideString
SQL:	then '			should be	then N'
SQL:	else '			should be	else N'
SQL:	as varchar		should be	as nvarchar
SQL:	[varchar]		should be	[nvarchar]

(Not used in CMDB:  Memo should be WideMemo,  Text should be WideText, ... ?)
