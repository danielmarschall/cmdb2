Artist form:
- Automatically calculate local amount

General:
- Try to copy as many things from the CMDB1 GUI as possible! Step by step until we have everything. (Tables are all checked and ok)
- Don't forget tools like the upload checker and folder comparison tool
- Also check all statistics
- Add setup
- Add screenshots (to README.md and VTS project page)

Ideas for the future:
- Mandator dependant text backup
- Allow connection to a real SQL server, to allow a client/server environment
- Let users define additional commission event picklist values, and artist event picklist values
- Allow drag'n'drop to the commission files shell view
- Button to jump back to the superior windows (or reopen them), e.g. when you are in a commission, go to the artist
