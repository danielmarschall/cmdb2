Statistics:
- upload check plugin: plugin to check uploads not in cmdb recorded

Ideas for the future:
- Let users define additional commission event picklist values, and artist event picklist values
- Allow drag'n'drop to the commission files shell view
- it would be good to have an overview of all commission or artist events by date, so you can see what has been added in the previous day. alternatively, commissions and artists could have a "last updated" date (which might also contain changes to the file system??)
