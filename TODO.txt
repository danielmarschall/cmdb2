Version 1.1:
- Tabelle ##STATISTICS existiert nicht, als ich von artist zu mandator zurück gegangen bin. warum?
- "Window" main menu item that lists all windows
- dmx/sd beta test
- plugin to check if folders exist
- plugin to check uploads not in cmdb recorded
- folder comparison : missing commissions (folder but no commission)
- folder comparison : missing folders (commission but no folder)
- bug: filtere in mandator-artists, dann gehe zu statistics, dann komme zurück, dann edit1 ist leer, aber dataset ist filtered
- backups should be automatically created on close.
	but take care if db connection is broken, then let the user exit the program!

General:
- Try to copy as many things from the CMDB1 GUI as possible! Step by step until we have everything. (Tables are all checked and ok)
- Don't forget tools like the upload checker and folder comparison tool
- Also check all statistics

Ideas for the future:
- Let users define additional commission event picklist values, and artist event picklist values
- Allow drag'n'drop to the commission files shell view
