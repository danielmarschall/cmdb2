Version 1.1:
- dmx/sd beta test
- plugin to check if folders exist
- plugin to check uploads not in cmdb recorded
- folder comparison : missing commissions (folder but no commission)
- folder comparison : missing folders (commission but no folder)

General:
- Try to copy as many things from the CMDB1 GUI as possible! Step by step until we have everything. (Tables are all checked and ok)
- Don't forget tools like the upload checker and folder comparison tool
- Also check all statistics

Ideas for the future:
- Let users define additional commission event picklist values, and artist event picklist values
- Allow drag'n'drop to the commission files shell view
