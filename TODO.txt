Commission form:
- Allow non upload and non quote events to add an annotation
- Button to jump back to the artist window

General:
- Try to copy as many things from the CMDB1 GUI as possible! Step by step until we have everything. (Tables are all checked and ok)
- Don't forget tools like the upload checker and folder comparison tool
- Also check all statistics
- Publish at GitHub, add Setup

Ideas:
- Mandator dependant text backup
- Allow connection to a real SQL server, to allow a client/server environment
- Let users define additional commission event picklist values, and artist event picklist values
- Allow drag'n'drop to the commission files shell view
