Plugin development:
	basic stats plugin:
	- stats: show things that must be paid
	- stats: show things that needs to be done (td)
	- stats: show things that are awaited (aw)
	- stats: show things that must be uploaded (upload c / upload a)
	
	upload check plugin:
	- plugin to check uploads not in cmdb recorded
	
	folder check plugin:
	- plugin to check if folders exist
	- folder comparison : missing commissions (folder but no commission)
	- folder comparison : missing folders (commission but no folder)

General:
- Try to copy as many things from the CMDB1 GUI as possible! Step by step until we have everything. (Tables are all checked and ok)
- Don't forget tools like the upload checker and folder comparison tool
- Also check all statistics

Ideas for the future:
- Let users define additional commission event picklist values, and artist event picklist values
- Allow drag'n'drop to the commission files shell view
- Backups should be password protected, especially the CSV files. Otherwise, password protection is rather useless, isn't it?
